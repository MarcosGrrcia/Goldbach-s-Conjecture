# Goldbach-s-Conjecture
A C/C++ program that shows all possible prime addends of a user-inputted sum using partitioning and recursive algorithms.
The program is ran by inputting into the console: ./Goldbach
Then, you can insert any whole number value up to 2000, and the program will show you all the possible additions of prime 
numbers that can result in that value.
